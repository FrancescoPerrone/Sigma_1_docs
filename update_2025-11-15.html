       ================================ -->
  <section id="plain-language-intro" class="section">
    <h2>How to Read This Document (Non-Financial Summary)</h2>
    <p>
      This update explains, in a structured way, a simple but crucial question for Sigma-1:
      <strong>“When does the project start paying for itself, and under what conditions does it become a healthy business?”</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer this, we use the classic tools that large companies and investors use: break-even analysis,
      unit economics (LTV/CAC), and cash-flow projections. The core of the document is technical on purpose,
      because it must withstand scrutiny from investors, Invitalia reviewers, and potential partners.
      However, you do not need to be a finance expert to take away the main messages.
    </p>
    <div class="card-plain">
      <h3>In very simple terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Break-even month</strong> = the month when Sigma-1 has generated enough margin to repay
          what we have spent on engineering, pilots, connectivity, and customer acquisition.</li>
        <li><strong>LTV/CAC</strong> tells us whether each customer/asset we acquire creates value
          (LTV/CAC &gt; 1) and whether it is attractive for investors (good targets are ≈3× or more).</li>
        <li><strong>Payback period</strong> = how many months of subscription margin are needed to recover
          what we spent to win a customer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        The rest of the document applies these concepts to the Sigma-1 business model. You can read only the
        blue cards like this one for an intuitive understanding, or dive into the formulas if you want to
        validate the method in detail.

       1. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (UNCHANGED)
       ================================ -->
  <section id="break-even-extended" class="section">
    <h2>Break-even & Unit Economics — Executive Analysis for Sigma-1</h2>

    <p><strong>Objective.</strong> Provide a board-grade break-even and unit-economics analysis for Sigma-1, using
    standard corporate-finance formulas and subscription metrics (SaaS-style), and show how these translate into
    launch decisions (pricing, channel mix, ramp, risk). All formulas below are industry-standard.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>1) Foundations — What “break-even” means for Sigma-1</h3>
    <p><strong>Classical break-even (BEP)</strong> occurs where <em>total revenue</em> exactly covers <em>fixed + variable costs</em>.
    The canonical formulas are:</p>

    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>In units:</strong> <code>BEP_units = FixedCosts / (Price_per_unit − VariableCost_per_unit)</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>In revenue:</strong> <code>BEP_revenue = FixedCosts / ContributionMarginRatio</code>, with
          <code>ContributionMarginRatio = (Price − VariableCost) / Price</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        These are the standard definitions used in corporate planning models (SBA, CFI, and mainstream
        managerial accounting textbooks).
      </p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Why this matters here.</strong> Sigma-1 is a <em>hardware-enabled recurring-service</em> product
    (SmartTag + Cloud + Certification + Alerts). Classical BEP must therefore be combined with <em>subscription economics</em>
    (MRR/ARR, churn, LTV, CAC) to capture the true break-even month and the payback window on acquisition spend.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>2) Subscription Layer — Revenue, churn and cumulative cash</h3>

    <h4>2.1 Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) ramp</h4>
    <p>
      With a cohort-based launch, let <code>New_t</code> be new paying assets/customers in month <code>t</code>,
      and <code>Churn_t</code> the number that cancel. Customers evolve as:
      <code>Cust_t = Cust_{t−1} + New_t − Churn_t</code>.
      If ARPA is the average monthly revenue per asset, then
      <code>MRR_t = Cust_t × ARPA</code>. Cumulative revenue up to month <code>m</code> is
      <code>Σ_{t=1..m} MRR_t</code>. Churn is conventionally measured as
      <code>Churn_rate = Churned_customers / Customers_begin</code> per period.
    </p>

    <h4>2.2 Churned MRR vs. Customer churn</h4>
    <p>
      For tiered pricing and enterprise contracts, tracking <em>MRR churn</em> (lost recurring revenue) is more
      informative than pure customer churn, especially with upgrades/downgrades:
      <code>MRR_churn_t = Lost_MRR_t − Expansion_MRR_t</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>2.3 Gross margin and contribution from the service layer</h4>
    <p>
      For each active asset, per-month <em>gross contribution</em> ≈ <code>ARPA × GrossMargin</code>.
      Contribution margin is the revenue left after variable service costs (connectivity, per-transaction
      fees, variable support). This is the numerator that repays fixed engineering, certification, and
      acquisition costs.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>3) Unit Economics — LTV, CAC, Payback</h3>

    <h4>3.1 Customer Lifetime Value (subscription approximation)</h4>
    <p>
      With constant ARPA, gross margin <code>g</code> and monthly churn rate <code>c</code>, a widely used
      steady-state approximation is: <code>LTV ≈ (ARPA × g) / c</code>.
      This formula arises from the expected lifetime of a geometric survival process (<code>1/c</code> months).
      Target <code>LTV/CAC ≥ 3×</code> is a common software/recurring benchmark for healthy economics.
    </p>

    <h4>3.2 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h4>
    <p>
      <code>CAC = Total_acquisition_spend / New_paying_customers</code>.
      Use fully-loaded spend (media, sales, onboarding, incentives) to avoid understating CAC.
    </p>

    <h4>3.3 Payback period on CAC</h4>
    <p>
      An investor-standard KPI: <code>Payback_months ≈ CAC / (ARPA × g)</code> ignoring churn during ramp;
      more precisely, solve the cumulative gross contribution from the cohort against CAC to the month where it
      turns positive. In classic capital budgeting, payback is
      <code>InitialInvestment / AverageAnnualCashFlow</code>; here we adapt it to recurring revenue.
    </p>

    <!-- ================================
         MID-DOCUMENT NARRATIVE BRIDGE
         ================================ -->
    <div class="card-plain">
      <h3>Mid-way Reading Guide — What Have We Established So Far?</h3>
      <p>
        Up to this point the document has defined the “grammar” of the analysis:
        how revenue builds up over time, how churn erodes it, and how acquisition cost and
        fixed engineering have to be repaid. For a non-financial reader, the key ideas are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each Sigma-1 asset produces a <strong>monthly margin</strong> (ARPA × gross margin).</li>
        <li>We spend money upfront to build the platform and to <strong>acquire customers</strong> (CAC).</li>
        <li>Break-even happens when the sum of these monthly margins, across all active assets,
            has repaid those upfront costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The next sections apply these definitions to the 24-month Sigma-1 roadmap, in order to say:
        <em>“If we follow the Lean plan, we expect break-even to appear roughly between month 18 and month 20, assuming
        our main assumptions on price, churn and gross margin hold.”</em>
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>4) Break-even Month for Sigma-1 — Cohort cash view</h3>
    <p>
      Let fixed engineering and overhead spread over 24 months be <code>F</code> (certifications, firmware,
      backend, pilots), and let <code>CAC_t</code> be acquisition cash in month <code>t</code>.
      Define monthly <em>gross contribution</em> as <code>GC_t = MRR_t × g − VariableServiceCosts_t</code>.
      The <strong>cumulative operating cash</strong> by month <code>m</code> (pre-tax) is:
    </p>

    <pre><code>CASH(m) = −F  − Σ_{t=1..m} CAC_t  + Σ_{t=1..m} GC_t</code></pre>

    <p>
      The <strong>break-even month</strong> is the smallest <code>m*</code> with <code>CASH(m*) ≥ 0</code>.
      For a ramp where MRR grows until month 12 and then stabilises, <code>m*</code> typically lands
      around months 18–20 under prudent settings (reflecting “Year-1 build / Year-2 harvest”).
      This aligns with the roadmap and hiring plans in the Gantt chart.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        <strong>Engineering cross-check (classical revenue BEP).</strong>
        Using contribution margin ratio <code>CMR</code> on the recurring revenue stream (after variable service costs),
        a revenue-style BEP for the service layer alone is:
        <code>BEP_revenue = FixedCosts / CMR</code>.
        This recovers the standard managerial accounting formula, re-interpreted for subscriptions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h3>5) Strategic Metrics Boards Expect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LTV/CAC</strong>: target ≥ 3×; if &lt;1×, growth destroys value; if ≫5×, the company may be
          under-investing in growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Rule of 40</strong> (growth % + free-cash-flow % ≥ 40) as a sanity check on value creation once
          scale is reached.</li>
      <li><strong>Payback</strong> &lt; 12 months for SMB/PLG motions; up to 18–24 months can be acceptable in
          deep-tech / enterprise settings where retention is high and ARPA/gross margin are strong.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>6) Operational Implications for Sigma-1</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Hybrid pricing.</strong> A configuration where hardware is sold at modest margin but the
        subscription/service layer is mandatory and high-margin shortens payback and stabilises revenue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Churn control.</strong> OTA reliability, incident response and “no-gap” alerts reduce churn
        <code>c</code>; since <code>LTV ≈ (ARPA × g)/c</code>, even modest improvements in churn have an outsized
        impact on value creation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gross-margin stewardship.</strong> Negotiating connectivity, infrastructure and blockchain costs
        as usage grows increases <code>g</code>, improving both LTV and break-even timing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Acquisition efficiency.</strong> Partner channels (auction houses, museums, insurers, logistics)
        reduce CAC vs pure paid media; lower CAC means faster payback and earlier cash break-even.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cohort discipline &amp; pricing tests.</strong> Tracking MRR churn and expansion by segment
        supports rational price changes and validates the subscription tiers (per-asset, institutional API).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h3>7) Sensitivity & Scenario Readiness</h3>
    <p>
      Boards and funding bodies expect a sensitivity view on the main drivers
      <code>(ARPA, churn c, g, CAC, ramp speed)</code>.
      The two levers that matter most for Sigma-1 are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Churn (c).</strong> A reduction of just −1 percentage point in monthly churn improves LTV markedly
        and typically pulls the break-even month earlier by several months.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gross margin (g).</strong> Each +10-point improvement in gross margin lowers payback and improves
        both LTV and Rule-of-40 metrics.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In practice we therefore propose decision gates at months 3, 6 and 9 where the observed cohorts
      (pilots with auction houses, museums, insurers) are assessed against target churn, ARPA and incident rate
      before committing larger advertising budgets.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>8) Governance Checklist for Funding Committees</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Validated break-even month from cohort data vs. plan (<code>CASH(m)</code> crossing zero).</li>
      <li>Stable <strong>LTV/CAC ≥ 3×</strong> and <strong>payback ≤ 18 months</strong> for the target motion.</li>
      <li>Clear trajectory toward the <strong>Rule of 40</strong> once ARR has reached scale.</li>
      <li>Contribution margin per tier, with audited connectivity and blockchain costs.</li>
      <li>BEP in revenue form cross-checked against engineering and certification budgets.</li>
    </ul>

       9. CLOSING PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY
       ================================ -->
  <section id="plain-language-conclusion" class="section">
    <div class="card-plain">
      <h3>What This Means in Practice for CogiteQ &amp; Sigma-1</h3>
      <p>
        Summarising the analysis in everyday language:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If we execute the Lean roadmap as planned, <strong>Sigma-1 is expected to reach financial break-even
          roughly between month 18 and month 20</strong>. Before that point, the project consumes cash;
          after that point, each additional customer increases our financial resilience.
        </li>
        <li>
          The project only makes sense as a <strong>hardware + subscription</strong> business.
          Selling devices alone would push break-even far into the future; the service layer
          (tracking, alerts, certification, analytics) is where value and stability are created.
        </li>
        <li>
          Three variables deserve daily attention: <strong>price (ARPA), churn and gross margin</strong>.
          Small improvements here are more valuable than large cuts elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          Partner channels (auction houses, museums, insurers, logistics operators) are not only commercial
          entries but also a way to keep <strong>CAC under control</strong>, which is essential to meet
          the payback and LTV/CAC thresholds expected by investors and Invitalia.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, this document shows that Sigma-1 can be financially sound under realistic assumptions,
        but only if we treat the service layer as the core of the business and if we systematically measure the
        unit economics of each cohort from the first pilots onward.
